This program (released under the Apache licence)
says hello continually on the Tomu's low-power serial port.

It can also build an image that can be run on qemu.

For QEMU:
  Get a copy of the bootloader by doing
      make get_bootloader
  then build an image:
      make hello-qemu.img


You can run it by doing
    qemu-system-arm -M tomu -nographic -kernel hello-qemu.img

This assumes you're using Shenki's QEMU port, available from
https://github.com/shenki/qemu/tree/efm32hg
